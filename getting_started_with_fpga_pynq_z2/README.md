# Getting Started with FPGAs (PYNQ-Z2 Board)

!\[image](./images/fpga_board.jpg)

### About

This repository contains source code from the book Getting Started with FPGAs by Russell Merrick (link).

Only the Verilog parts of the book are implemented.

The code in this repository is meant to be used with the PYNQ-Z2 (link)

This project uses the PYNQ-Z2 switches and the Digilent Seven-segment Pmod Display (link)

Code and simulation is implemented using Vivado 2024.2.2

### Contents

##### Project 1: Switches to LEDs

Connect 4 switches to 4 LEDs. If you press a switch, the corresponding LED will turn on.

##### Project 2: AND Gate

Connect 2 switches to 2 LEDs using an AND gate. If you press both switches, the LED will turn on.

##### Project 3: LED Toggle

Connect a switch to an LED. If you press the switch, the LED will toggle on or off.

##### Project 4: Debounce

An improvement of Project 3 by adding a switch debouncer.

##### Project 5: Demux

A combination of a clock divider and a demultiplexer. We blink one of 4 LEDs selected using the demultiplexer.

##### Project 6: Memory Game

An implementation of a memory game similar to Simon (link) using switches for input, LEDs for indicators, and a seven-segment display for showing the score.

### Simulations

##### Simulation 1: AND Gate

Simulate the AND gate.

##### Simulation 2: Debounce

Simulate the debouncer module.

##### Simulation 3: State Machine

Simulate a state machine of a turnstile. The testbench includes assertions.
